### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate student at Northeastern on track to obtain a bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics by June 2024. I am always trying to learn new languages and enhance my problem solving skills and knowledge. My favorite part about coding is creating applications that I can share to the world such as websites, apps,and games. I hope to get a job where I can use my skills to create something everyone will love.
